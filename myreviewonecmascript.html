        <p>I have no knowledge about javascript or how it works, but after watching the videos I was so surprised that the Javascript was written for just 10 days by Brendan Eich of Netscape communication. Even though javascript was not that popular before it has been developed, many developers have disagreed using it as a tool for web designs. When Netscape took Javascript to the Ecma standards group to maintain specifications for the language so it can possibly be implemented to other browsers. Javascript's popularity grew in the present years and it is being used by most website developers. Javascript is known for using in front & back end development.

            Javascript is one of the most important programming languages that most developers used in building a website. I think it is really good to have knowledge or know Javascript to formulate a better website.</p>
